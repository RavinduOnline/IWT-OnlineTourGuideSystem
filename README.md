Topic        : Online Tour Guide System
Project Id   : MLB_PG.07.02_06__Malabe
Batch        : 14.2
University   : Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)

*----- Description -----*

We did this as a project in the subject of Internet and Web Technologies - IT1100, which we studied in the second semester of the first year of our degree program.

This is an online tour guide website. This system offers two main services, travel package selection and hotel booking. The tourist can be new or currently registered to the system. Depending on the needs of the tourists, they can do anything in the system individually or through a currently registered travel agent. If the tourist is already a member of the website, he/she should log in to his account to get discounts/promotions. It is essential for a travel agent to log in to the agent account when providing services to a tourist through the system. Also, a commission will be paid automatically by the system to the agent when they provide the service to tourists. All the booking details then collected by the system . (this Include - Hotel booking, Travel Package Selecting, Tour Guide Selection, Payment Details). Tourists can hire a tour guide only when selecting a travel package if required. The website will automatically assign an already registered travel guide to the system based on the booking details provided by the tourist. After the guide assigned, a confirmation email will be sent to the relevant guide. The guide can see the work given by logging into their account.
