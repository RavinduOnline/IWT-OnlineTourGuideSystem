	Despite its small size Sri Lanka is a global leader in many a fields and is had been known worldwide for its choice gems, tea and cinnamon since the turn of the last century.

Sri Lankan cinnamon, ivory and gems had been the main cause for invasion of two nations, Portuguese and Dutch, who followed the Moor traders to the country in search of the world’s best spices and riches.

 According to the Dutch, who reorganized the cultivation and marketing of cinnamon in Sri Lanka, the ‘shores of Sri Lanka had been full of it, that you can smell it eight leagues out to sea’. 
 
 Even today the country produces the world best cinnamon and one of the world’s top cinnamon exporters.

However prior to the country shot to fame for its cinnamon, the world knew Sri Lanka for its beautiful and valuable gemstones.

 ‘Rathnadeepa’ or the ‘land of gems’ was used as a synonym for the country and even today the Sri Lankan gems specially the Ceylon blue sapphires are celebrated worldwide for their distinctive color and luster.

Yet it is the Ceylon tea, which the world identifies the country by. Introduced to the country in the 19th century by Colonial British, Sri Lanka had held the crown for producing the world’s best tea.

 Although many a countries had joined the world tea market, Ceylon Tea made in Sri Lanka still continues to be the favorite of the tea lovers worldwide.
